    <h4 class="h4">About the Game</h4>
    <p>Miraflora is not what it seems. The island is an untouched paradise, teeming with never-before-seen flora and possible miracle cures. You arrive as an experienced botanist with the goal of identifying and cataloging Miraflora's plant life using your finely honed skills in observation and problem-solving. But the island's history is a long and troubled one, and as more people come to Miraflora's shores, more pieces of its past float to the surface..</p>

    <p>What is Xylem?</p>
    <p>Xylem is a puzzle game! Players take on the role of a botanist tasked with analyzing exotic plant specimens and figuring out simple mathematical expressions to describe their behavior.   </p>
    <p>Your adventure begins at the Base Camp, the central hub of a great expedition to the newly discovered island of Miraflora. Here you'll run through a series of tutorial levels that will demonstrate how to use the tools in your Floraphase Comparator. Once you complete the tutorials, you'll be free to explore the various regions of Miraflora at your own pace to discover new plants and challenges. And as you continue solving puzzles, you'll also unearth clues and secrets about the mysterious island. </p>

    <h3 class="h3">Game GOALS</h3>
    <p>The goal of the game is to classify plants using formulas. Complete the formulas by selecting the correct plant species, mathematical function and numbers needed. </p>
    <p>You'll have images of plants to compare and multiple math symbols and numbers to choose from. Select the right combination that solves each image problem to move to the next classification.The goal of the game is to classify plants using formulas.

   <h3 class="h3">TIPS &amp; TRICKS</h3>
   <img src="i/v/tips.png" alt="" />
   <p>If you've already begun exploring Miraflora, you may have noticed that sometimes different plant specimens will display similar patterns in their growth phases. Some of these patterns you may have already seen at Base Camp.  </p>
    <p> There are a few patterns that you are very likely to encounter in some form during your journey through Miraflora, and they can be very effective identification tools when analyzing a plant. Now, these patterns almost never appear exactly in the field as they do here, and often times you'll see more than one pattern appear in the same plant. However, they can still be very useful when used as the basis for your working solution.</p>
