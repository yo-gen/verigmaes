	<p>Hi Ptonn - </p>
	<p>Thanks for your message - sorry you're having trouble!</p>
	<p>We should not require any special ports to be open, though we do use websockets. Most firewalls should allow them by default.  Did you install the Unity Web Player? (Is that what you mean by 'downloaded our web browser'?)</p>
	<p>Look forward to hearing from you, how this goes on further.   </p>
	<p>Aaron </p>

	<p>I have downloaded your web browser and given it access through my firewall. </p>
	<p>The login program just shows blinking lights and does not allow me to log in. What other firewall or security changes do I need. </p>
